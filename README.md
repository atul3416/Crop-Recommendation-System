# Introduction
A smart web-based application that recommends the most suitable crop based on soil conditions and environmental parameters using Machine Learning and Django.
## Project Overview
The Crop Recommendation System helps farmers and agricultural users choose the best crop to grow by analyzing key input features such as:
- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall

A trained Machine Learning model is used to predict the best crop, and the result is displayed through a user-friendly web interface developed with Django.
## Machine Learning Model
- Built using Python
- Trained on the standard Crop Recommendation Dataset
- Algorithms tested: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression
- Random Forest achieved the best accuracy and is used for predictions
- The trained model is saved as model.pkl and integrated into Django
